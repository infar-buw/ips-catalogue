## Recreational Land Use
Can be a subtype of [Recreational Land Use]().

* Area Requirement: 20,000 sqm

## Location
Can be used in connection with [City Center](), [Sub Center](), [Open Market]() or it can be seen as a seperate entity. Its location can be placed within [Land Use Distribution](), but also manually assisted by [Evaluation Score]() or through i.e. [Force-based Distribution](). Assisted with the [Boundary]() module, a site can be defined that is considering the context.

If noise is expected frequently, it might need to be considered to keep the location away from quiet areas such as residential areas.
