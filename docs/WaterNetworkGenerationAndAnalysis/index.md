This module generates and analyses a water network with the help of DeCodingSpaces components that make use of [EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET) for hydrology analysis. The water network is generated as a subset of the street network: It is generated by finding the shortest path from source to all taps, creating a tree-like network. By influencing the weights of streets i.e. preferably using primary streets, this tree-like network can adapt. Overlaying two tree-like structures allows us to create a water network which includes loops for redundancies.
