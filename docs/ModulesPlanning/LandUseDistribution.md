#### 1. Prepare evaluation profiles for land use types

* Choose necessary land uses such as [Residential](), [Industrial](), [Commercial]() Land Uses or even more specific ones such as [High Density Housing]().
* Prepare profiles according to preferred requirements.

#### 2. Gather evaluation criteria

* Consider evaluation criteria that could assist in distribution of land uses such as:

* Calculate [Distance To]() between land uses and streets.

* [Value At Point]() to measure slope of terrain, economic or ecological factors.

#### 3. Evaluate on base of land use profiles and criteria

* [Filtering]() areas that are too steep or already contain existing land uses.

* Get [Evaluation Score]() for each land use profile based on the evaluation criteria.

#### 4. Simulate distribution of land uses types  

* [Growth Simulation]() can simulate occupation of different land uses and distributes them step by step.
