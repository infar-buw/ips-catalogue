title: Pedestrian Movement
summary: 

---

Supply a walking distance radius (~300 m) to [Street Through Movement]() to see which street are potentially used more frequently by pedestrians or, to [Street To Movement]() to see where people might meet.

* [Slope](): 1 to 35%, on intersections < 6%
* Pedestrian lanes should have a minimum width of 6m
* Storm drainage should be done with 2.5% slope
* Avoid street perpendicular aligned to [Water Flow Direction]() for reasons of flooding.
* Should be protected from vehicular lanes by 15-20cm elevation
* If vehicles drive nearly walking speed, a visual separation of lanes through pavement is possible (shared surface)
