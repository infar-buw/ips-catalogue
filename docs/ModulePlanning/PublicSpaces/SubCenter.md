## Location
Sub center can be an elemental part of a city, serving public needs and providing public spaces. Therefore, its location can be specified early on in the city development process. Its location can be placed within [Land Use Distribution](), but also manually assisted by [Evaluation Score]() or through i.e. [Force-based Distribution]().

If a street network already exists in the phase of planning, it can be analysed through [Street Analysis - Movement To]() to identify hotspots in the city. Setting a radius of travelling distance such as for [Pedestrians]() allows to place sub centers in walkable distance.

* Can be kept close to primary and secondary roads for fast access.
  
  **Close** entities get **high** score (Combine [DistanceTo](), [StreetAnalysis - Movement To]() and [Scoring]())
