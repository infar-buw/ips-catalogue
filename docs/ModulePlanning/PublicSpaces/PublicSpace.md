Normally public space is all space belonging to the municipality in legal terms. However, it can also be related to places for gathering and pubilc activities. Therefore, in form of [Public Squares]() it can be integral part of [City Center]() or [Sub Center]() as well as other places such as [Open Market]().
A combination of [Street Movement Through]() and [Street Movement To]() can show viable locations for frequently used public spaces and therefore, can be recommendable for public functions and services.
