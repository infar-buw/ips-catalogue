#### Concept

The rapid uncontrolled expansion of urban centers in developing countries has become a challenge. One example of this is Ethiopia, where the capital Addis Ababa is rapidly growing into the country side, taking the valuable farming land. The population of Ethiopia is unable to react quickly enough to such a fundemental shift in the way of living. The current governement wants to solve this crisis by means of urbanization. For the next years the establishment of thousands of small productive towns on the place of current villages is planned.

#### Parametric Approach

Such an extensive task can be solved much more efficiently with a parametric approach than with traditional urban planning methods. This approach allows you to create a framework of your own rules that adapt to different paramenters. The aim of the Syn City project is to develop a reasonable city model, that is able to adapt to a given topography, climate and existing buildings, thus creating aan unique masterplan for each site

#### Main Idea

The idea of our proposal was to build the city model step by step, so that every part depends on the previous one and therefore a natural city development is simulated. At first we define a city boundary in order to exclude unbuildable areas; then we define the ring road and the boundary of the city center. As Ethiopia has a remarkable mountainous topology, we decided to grow the street network based on topography lines. Due to the ierarchy of the primary and secondary streets, we keep network as a kind of grid, but a grid adjusted to the topology conditions. Further functions distribution is based on the hierarchy of their requirements. For example, at first we place the church square on the highest spot in the city, afterwords we place the market square on the intersection of center ring and main road as a centerpiece of the new city. Further public functions are placed based on centrality requirement or space syntax analysis, indicating the most integrated areas of the networks. 
An important aspect of a successfull city is the functions mix. The modernists way of splitting city in functional zones is recognized as incorrect. To create a lively mixture, we extend the housing districts by creating local plazas. They provide identity for neighbourhoods and can be used either as public space or local markets. Every part of town has some areas suitable for home production or small workshops. 
The housing districts consist of individual farmer houses and row houses of three floors at maximum. There are 4 typologies, which are distributed according to the desired density. We dont implement larger housing buidlings in order to leave the inhabitants an opportunity to construct their houses by themselves. Moreover, such typologies allow every house unit to have some private garden area from backside, which is a core component of Ethiopian culture.

#### Dense vs. Rural

As production in the cities does not mean that agriculture is completely replaced, directly behind the ring road there is farming land. Ring road provides an easy access of machinery to the agricultural land. Though new cities are supposed to modernize the current lifestyle, foreign-looking cities would be barely tolerated and not at all loved. That‘s why our proposal attaches great importance to implementing as much as possible from the local context and developing the basics for a sustainable city out of it.
