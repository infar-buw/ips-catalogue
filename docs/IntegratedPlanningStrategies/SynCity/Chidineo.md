#### Concept

The city concept aims on decentralizing major city functions in the most integrated areas of the urban network to result in a more dispersed city core. The main functions of the city are distributed in nodes, which are the most integrated points of the street network. This way, even though more dispersed, it is possible to keep a well-structured and hierarchized city core. The development of the city from the center is a process of addition of nodes which provides, on one hand, different functions and uses. Therefore a diversity forms within the city, but on the other hand, it sets a framework where the city can grow at a continuous pace, only depending on the topographical features of a given site.
