#### Concept

The urbanization of Ethiopia‘s countryside must provide resilient infrastructures which anticipate growth and maintain accessibility. To that end, this plan parametrizes a productive town in which a vibrant economy emerges from sustainable manufacturing, education, and social mixing. We use street networks and topography to create visibility lines which allows the public to be aware of the production chain, as one walks through industrial courtyards where people work with raw materials, to the market where the merchandise is sold—all with a view of the city‘s industrial monuments.

To achieve this, the plan builds on the existing context of the town, placing the market at the most integrated point and incorporating major roads into the emerging grid. Next, the urban network and its primary functions are organized by connectivity patterns which promote walkability and street network differentiation. At the edges of town, industry is decentralized but sustainably designed to minimize environmental degradation and maximize livability. The result is a dense and diverse urban environment, an optimized industrial town for the new Ethiopia that does not sacrifice livability for productivity.
