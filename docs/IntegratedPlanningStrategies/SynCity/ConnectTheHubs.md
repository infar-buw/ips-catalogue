#### Concept

The motivation for our project is to create a city where Ethiopian people have an alternative to fast growing metropolises, like Addis Abeba, with the access to basic infrastructure, job
opportunities and better living standards.

Initial steps in macro level are to preserve
existing, natural, built-up and cultural
environments and complement it with a stable modular network of roads and infrastructure that can be used to remove and collect water for
flooded regions. Here, in micro-level, blocks and lots are defined. Their functions and configu-
rations are flexible to provide diversity, equality and possibility to adapt to demographic,
economic or climate changes.

The concept „connect the hubs“ provides the
Ethiopian people with a city which is shaped according to their daily life, connecting necessary facility blocks into equally distributed network. The cities that we designed would allow any
substantial changes in the scale of blocks and lots (micro-scale) while maintaining basic macro-scale structure. In addition, the city can respond to its specific natural or economic threats with its own resources.
