#### Concept

Parametric masterplanning was chosen as the best way to approach Ethiopian's ongoing issue of a need for new small towns which will serve as regional centres in rural areas. With this exchange of rural living for a more urban style
doesn't mean only new buildings and infrastructure but also a whole different way of living. Therefore the change has tobe done gently and always keeping in mind what is today essential for Ethiopian people. Their dependency on the farmlands and animals can be changed but it has tobe taken in small steps. Our approach is creating a city with 7 - 8 districts which can be built as phases of a project, one by one. At this pace of raising the city, there is no need to take all the farmlands at once, but rather start the change slowly, with lmplementlng the most important functions region by region.

#### Process

SLOPE ANALYSIS is an important step where we look at the surrounding land around our site. For better placement of the roads and buildings we choose areas with slope less than 11°. and cull the rest. In the hilly sites of Anko Golma and Haro Welabu we get a preliminary look at how the city shape could be, in the quite falt site of Fefa Dildiy we can aim for more optimal circu lar shape of the city.

Naturally the existing main road is the most imporant street in the future city, we decided to build the city around it but in a LAND RATIO of approximately 70:30. The reason is to not divide the town into two separate areas, rather a smaller and bigger part. We place the industry in the smaller part whilst we check for the dominant wind direction. so the town isn't affected by any possible fumes.

With the main focus on our centre point which we call "Node Zero" we analyse the preliminary area within our City boundary and find optimal points which serve as REGION CENTRES. That way we can spread the most important functions not only in the centre point. The main node serves as the most important place since it gives space for market. The market goverment building and cultural center give this region a special va lue, making it different from all the other regions. The node zero is placed on a point on the main road which serves as a centre in the existing town and the new nodes are equally distrubuted within the boundary so the city has one main and more local districts.

By connecting the nodes with boundary, main road and within themselves we get a PRIMARY STREET NETWORK. We analyse the newly created street blocks and divide then accordingly to to their size to smaller blocks. 

So we divide the imporant functions according the regions. But in order for these functions eo be easily accessible from the other regions aswell, we create a list of highly connected areas based on how many regions intersect their WALKABILITY RADIUS in these places. For some functions there are special conditions, for example schools shouldn't be placed on busy roads, religion buildings be distributed in different places, etc.
