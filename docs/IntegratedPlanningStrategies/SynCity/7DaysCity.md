#### Concept

Making a city an attractive place, is an urban project that provides an environment where the inhabitants have convenient access to parks and squares and can find their places easily, feel as actor of the city and have opportunities for their self development.

At the public places the social life of cities takes place, uniting its residents and creating new ties. This concept is based on spontaneity and an organic feel. It is guided by the natural principal of the water flow and the topography to set up a street network. Streets planned with a low slope to reduce the effort for citizens to move in the city.

In addition to the benefits of short distances achieved by a densification to 40 people per hectare, a significant amount of land is being saved by reducing the urban sprawl. After selecting a sight, the street network is the second most important factor of any city with a high living quality. Once a grid is laid out, it is very difficult to change. The city structure provides living in green neighborhoods with short walking connections and the functions distribution will support the inhabitantâ€˜s creativity and make a rich and prolific urban life happen. Preserving local tradition is attained by incorporating the existing structure.

With this concept and automated process of planning is possible within a short time to plan an unlimited amount of unique cities which have a natural perception and provide a solid foundation for a high living quality.
