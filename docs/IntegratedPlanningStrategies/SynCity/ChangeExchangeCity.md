#### Concept

Since Ethiopia recognizes a rapid urbanization trend and will experience a high population influx from rural to urban areas in the future, each new city of currently 2500 planned cities will be faced with new challenges in social, economic and environmental questions.
In which way can we plan productive cities with strong identities, where interconnections among people, infrastructure and services can be placed, and moreover, where a livable and resilient city is given to its citizens? A city that couples urban change with social exchange?

The City takes the city as an ecosystem which contains social, economic and urban sub-ecosystems. The organization of this city-concept is organized under a node system based on three levels of connections: MACRO â€“ MESO - MICRO which allows interconnections among the city and citizens. This exchange pattern will ensure a dynamic self-sufficient community life, allowing this new city to be productive as well as humane. The MACRO interconnections will ensure the economic sustainability and civic society organization. Each MACRO node has related MESO nodes that provide diversity of functions and exchange values defined by standardized walkable distances. The meso-nodes play the role as transmitters from MICRO nodes of personal networks to MACRO nodes of citizen community.
