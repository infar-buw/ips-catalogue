#### Main Goals

- **Density**
High density city to waste as little
surrounding land as possible, while still
keeping recreational areas and varying
building typologies for a pleasant residence.
- **Location**
The city should be located on a place
concerning topography, future city expansion
possibilities and connection to surrounding
cities. Each location in the built up area
should be in easily reachable.
- **Adaptability**
The algorithm needs to be adaptable to
different factors such as topography,
connectivity to surrounding cities, city size,
building typologies.

#### Methods

- **City Boundary**
Physically calculated city boundary to find the
least sloped city area on the given location.
- **Node-based function distribution**
Functions in the city network are distributed
using locational relations and importance
tables between them.
- **Space Syntax for dense district distribution**
Betweenness values are being used to
distribute residential and commercial
typologies within the city.
