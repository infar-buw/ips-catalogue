#### Concept 

Our concept starts through knowing that our project is going to server primarily for young people and education, other than to give the chance to these communities to have drinkable water and electricity to improve their life conditions.

#### City Framework

We started from the existing main street and market square (when there is one). As this main infrastructure is the macro connection with the closest existing cities, we decided to build a multicentral 10k city interconnected in a radial way among each other. We needed a small distance between all the main functions because of the almost complete absence of vehicles in these environments: so we decided to split the main functions (educational, cultural and governmental) in small clusters, so that each small center is going to be provided with everything people would need.
We also decided to build the entire city only on one side of the main street, and use the other side, when possible, to build the industrial part. We also provided the main street with a line of buildings that are going to characterize the most economical and buisness part of the city. The part that actually needs the direct connection with the main street to import/export products. The main market square is also positioned on the main street, since their cultural way to see this place is strictly related to the connections with other cities. That is going to be infact the main place whre theyÂ´re going to sell their products in the city.

#### Building the City

The analysis of the buildable surface is the first step we did, so that we ensured that the steepness of the grond was not too high.
That and the minimum area that we needed to build our city ( around 600.000 sqm) gave us the boundary of the city and of the industrual area.
Then we used the position of the market square as one of our centers, and build the other three centers dividing the boundary surface we obtained from the analysis in equal parts and taking centers that have a very similar distance among each others. The connections among the 4 centers are always the basis of the street network.

#### City and Functions
The street network is created so that each center has its own boundary to contain the main functions and connections with the main street and city boundary to provide the final street network.
We decided to build the whole city not over two storeys, and the distances between the main functions not over 200-250 meters, so that from every part of the city it is possible to reach the needed function in a walkable distance.
We started by placing these functions infact. Primary schools, kindergardens, secondary schools, cultural buildings and governmental facilities.
Then we used the space syntax analysis to place the main commercial buildings on the most walked paths. We created a typology for these streets, with commercial and small public open spaces.
Then we placed all the rest of the functions in relationship with their needs. The remaining blocks inside the centers boundaries are block houses with apartments, the blocks near the main boundary are single house typology with small integrated industries and the rest of the blocks outside the centers boundaries with row houses typology.
