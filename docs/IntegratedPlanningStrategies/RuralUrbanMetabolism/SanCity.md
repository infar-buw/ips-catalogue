#### Concept

The main goal of the project is to evolve a strategy that can be used for the development of different rural areas in Ethiopia. The own knowledge and experience, as well as the research in a variety of directions and domains, was used to create a framework which could be applied to the different areas that share similar features. Different maps and plans, research papers and the information from the excursion to Ethiopia were the essentials for evaluating the existing situation.

The development strategy for rural areas’ upgrade in Ethiopia is based on three main factors, which are farming, forestry, and provision of housing. The framework is focusing on these topics to develop an agriculture network and enhance them to reinforce a sustainable city development in Ethiopia.
