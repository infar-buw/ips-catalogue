#### Concept

The intense population growth and thus the urbanization leads to the emerge of new cities in the Ethiopian rural areas. This rural-urban transformation will take place in a very short period of time and will require very careful and integrated planningstrategies to ensure the mitigation of impacts on the environment and the integration of bottom-up strategies for a humane environment. (ARUP, 2016a; Gehl, 2010)

Therefore, this strategy called Balancing Wurer is NOT just to develop a set design for an environmental friendly Wurer. It is rather to provide a PARTICIPATION TOOL, taking the protected goods into acount and helping the rural communities to make the right DECISIONS for developing a balanced LANDUSE-PLAN.(Zimmermann, 2014)
Urban planning must be thought of interdisciplinary. The planning should include specialist planners, administrations, stakeholders and citizens. 

The planning strategy can be explained in three steps: 

1. Firstly the conduction of a comprehensive, integrative analysis has to be made, to understand the rural urban metabolism. 

2. The second step includes an integrative, participatory planning game – we named it Metabolism Tetris!
The game translates the assumptions regarding the population growth, consumption of resources and the productivity of resource producing land uses (see decision tree) in different scenarios within a virtual grid-based computer simulation. 
The result is a grid showing the potential areas for each landuse, from which the the participants of a workshop can pick, because they are the experts of their own cities, knowing details no planner could ever think of. 
The goal of the game is to balance the population demands with land use grid cells in 3-time steps.

3. In the third step a landuse plan and following a master plan can be developed from the best scenarios/ variants. The goals which were set in the beginning can be proven in the end result: a grassroot-designed, environmental friendly Masterplan created together with the community for the community.
