#### Concept

With the development of Ethiopia, this country is facing lots of urban issues as a developing country. In the next decade, the population of Ethiopia will have a rapid growth and the urbanisation improves dramatically, which will have great influence on the life quality of Ethiopians.

The main goal of our design is to create a design model for Ethiopian cities, which can keep the original life pattern â€“ which we identify different from life style, a pattern relating social activities and ordinary life to the spatial aspect, with a clear structure - and improve the life quality of local people. Moreover, another problem is how to deal with the economic development which is the most important way to improve the life quality of citizens.

According to the resources the city have, the designers find the best way for the city to achieve the goals. Through the study of citizens in detail, the designers sort out the basic facilities and public spaces they need in their daily life. By rearranging the facilities in cities, there will be a bright new urban environment in the future.
