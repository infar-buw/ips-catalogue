#### Concept

Water is one of the first issues that comes to mind when thinking about urban planning in Sub-Saharan Africa and the case of Ethiopia is no difference. For the team’s main concept water and its use in Agriculture were chosen as the main metabolism factors to focus on. By optimizing the amount of water that could be harvested through the urban structure, we can better plan agriculture in order to be self-sufficient and industrialize in a more sustainable way.

The team’s main goal was to create a city that can provide enough food and water for the people living in it while maintaining a good quality of life considering infrastructure, connections, and walkability as well as open spaces.

Eventually the team was able to create a system that can support the type of agricultural that Ethiopia is known for, which could be applied in other locations to test whether an area could support a settlement using  agriculture. And if it does find the optimum area, location, density and layout for it.
