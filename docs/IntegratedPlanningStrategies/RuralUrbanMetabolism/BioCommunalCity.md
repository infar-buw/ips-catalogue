#### Concept

The majority of Africa’s population will shift from rural to urban in the next thirty years. Since the population growth and lack of infrastructure in Ethiopia, we create the concept of "Bio and communal" city to deal with this problem, making it a sustainable city . To build a better city with rational transportation and service systems in Danisa, the “multi-center” model could be an optimal choice.  

Our group aim to ”Create a new sustainable bio communal city“ which could be self-sufficient advantage to its agriculture ecosystems and environment. The agriculture in the unit not only feed the dramatic growth of population but also provide the products and materials for neighbourhoods as well as the general career prospects for local communities.
 
Our strategy can be seen in three levels. In the macro level, we create a “multi-center” model to sustain the increasing population. In the middle level, we create a “neighbourhood unit” model to share the service and food. In the micro level, we create a “bio system” neighbourhood block to turn agriculture waste to biogas and then generate energy for themselves.
