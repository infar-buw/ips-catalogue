#### Concept

The custom-city project is an urban development strategy which is following the demands of the citizens.

The focus is on creating a land use plan which is customised to the actual living conditions and the financial capabilities of each individuum in order to enable access to work, affordable housing, social environment and infrastructure.

It was of upmost importance for the project, that the legislative framework of the custom-city is a structure which guides and enables the lifestyle of each individual, instead of prescribing it. To achieve this following main accesses were holistically investigated:

1. Access to work / housing
    - balance income and expenses
    - work space and affordable housing

2. Access to social environment
    - preferred location
    - individual plot usage

3. Access to infrastructure
    - zoning and facilities
    - street network
