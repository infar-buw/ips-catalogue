#### Concept

On the example of Seriti we show our concept of a walkable city with reasonable distances to create the base for a sustainable city. Beside many advantages of the walkability concept, there is a need for walkable cities in Ethiopia caused by a low automobile rate. Our planning strategy is based on hexagonal service areas of different sizes for the different facilities. We connect those facilities by an optimized street network, to get a high accessibility with walkable distances inside the city and in the surrounding farmland. In our scenarios we show in detail, how we can adjust this walkability by changing the influence of the next bigger city, Ch’ach’a, scaling the service areas and modifying the city boundary.
