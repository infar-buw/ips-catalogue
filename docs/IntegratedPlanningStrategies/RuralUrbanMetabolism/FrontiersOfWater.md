#### Concept

Wurer2 - Frontiers of Water is a city development toolkit applied for an existing rural town in Ethiopia. Developed in the summer term study project of the Advanced Urbanism and European Urban Studies course, Wurer2 creates a selfsufficient community by providing inhabitants with a thorough communal water and wastewater infrastructure. Having conducting both literature-based research and site studies, a community development concept has been created, that strengthens the cultural cohesion of the city through economic self-sufficiency and the provision of shared community facilities. Modelled within Grasshopper and Rhinoceros, Wurer2 creates an urban planning toolkit for city planners and decision makers. Based on existing site conditions like regional topography and urban fabric, Wurer2 can generate a street network that is optimised for water distribution and drainage, upon which the user can apply land use typologies and place residential housing and community infrastructure. The final model illustrates Wurer's development in three different economic scenarios and at increasing stages of growth.
