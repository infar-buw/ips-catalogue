#### Concept

In the scope of a rural-urban transformation based on urban metabolism system project in Ethiopia, an adaptable parametric model for a self-sufficient & livable rural town is developed. The priority in this project is to secure water provision while keeping the independency in food and energy, and allowing various opportunities for economic growth. Therefore, a low-cost, technically, and economically feasible water network is proposed to offer a rational water supply system based on different uses, including clean drinking, domestic, agricultural, and industrial water. Through a parametric model allows designing the urban form, it aimed to ensure the best performance of the water system. The design proposal consists of three main steps: street network adjustment, land use scenario, and integration of public facilities, including public spaces, schools, kindergartens, and administrative center. Each step is assumed as a branch point for different design decisions and might be used as a starting point in decision-making process. The parametric approach allows generating three different integrated urban development scenarios based on monocentric, polycentric and linear center principles. In this paper, it describes one scenario in details and roughly observes two others pointing out key features.  

#### Process

Through the reasonable layout of the water system and the diversification of the water cycle the planning strategy ensures users with safe water supply, while keeping it low-cost and coherent with the current socio-cultural structure and habits. The water system will influence on urban metabolism and spatial distribution. To achieve equal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all, the parametric model will be based on the following strategies(see Fig. 6):
In the rain season, each household will collect rainwater from the plot locally. The land re-use it for domestic purposes.
1.	The rainwater from public spaces (streets and squares) will be collected via the network of the landscape-oriented structure of water channels, following high- and low-altitude streets. Being collected in the ponds, located in the lowest points with sufficient catchment area, this water will be re-used to irrigate agricultural fields.
2.	The existing forest is kept not only as a linear park potential but also allowing the sustainable rainwater drainage.
3.	The main source of drinking water is the well, supported by a water tower, situated on the high altitude. After treatment, the clean water is transferred through the pipe system to the network of public spaces.
4.  In each plot has a public space. The public spaces are designed to provide communal access to tap water, shower, and toilet. Also, the biomass and wastewater will be treated in the small biogas units, providing energy supply for the neighbourhood

**Diverse lifestyles and interaction**
To allow a smooth transition from the agricultural society to manufacturing and industry-oriented one and to support the national strategy of industry decentralization, two lifestyles will result in diverse urban forms. One part of the population is supposed to continue the existing agricultural rural pattern of single-family houses (see Fig. 7) and to provide food security for the city. In the meanwhile, another population group will work in a more compact urban pattern, which is full of industrial, retail and service economic sectors. Therefore, they prefer a denser urban structure of multi-stories buildings with mix-use (see Fig. 8). To allow the social interaction the system of public spaces is generated, which will provide access to water facilities (see Fig. 9).
