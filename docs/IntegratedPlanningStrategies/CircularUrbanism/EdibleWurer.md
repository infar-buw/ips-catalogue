#### Concept

Today the world faces a crisis in the food provision system. Environmental degradation through monocultures and deforestation, together with problems of food injustice, high rates of food waste and a failing agriculture system create a huge urban-rural challenge. In this light, how would a city which provides a healthy and sustainable food system look like? Using Wurer, Ethiopia, as a case study, we propose a design with merged housing and food production typologies allowing a smaller and more sustainable production and enhancing the reuse of resources and clustering the production and the consumer sources. The design relies on the combination of parametric design models and urban metabolism concepts as its core approach.

#### Planning strategy

The traditional way of agriculture is a failing technique. Therefore, while researching alternatives, we came across permaculture as a proven sustainable alternative.

Permaculture follows a couple of principles, which basically describes “a set of decision-making tools, based on natural systems, for arriving at regenerative solutions to design challenges of all kinds”, (Hemenway, 2015) as in this case for a city. For the planning concept of Wurer we extracted three main principles of permaculture philosophy: Using and valuing diversity - in a city scale meaning a diversity of typologies of agriculture, housing, functions and energy sources - lead to greater resilience. Supporting integration in the form of building synergies between different functions makes the system more efficient. Enhancing self-regulation and accepting feedback means in the city scale to allow informal and experimental development as a chance for improvements.

Translating this idea spatially, we rethink the shape of a city and the spatial distribution of its different land uses. As we want to support a place that enhances nature and human settlement both at the same time we also start the development of the place from both sides. On one side existing nature is protected and expanded by reforestation. The location of the sustainable cultivation methods of agroforestry and silvopasture are planed adjoining to the existing forest. From the other, human side existing structures are supplemented by missing facilities. A central replicable hub clusters the main resources to be distributed throughout the city, commercial nodes are rooted in denser housing areas and processing units with composting stations are closer to the bigger agricultural farmlands. This combination together with walkability and accessibility design standards allow both natural and human developments to mingle and grow together, also facilitating interaction and meeting points.

This project aims to create an edible city, where agriculture and food production happen inside its boundaries and thereby close to the consumer, making metabolism tangible and keeping routes of transport short. In this way, not only the citizens are close to what they eat, but the metabolism loop is closed, as waste is also considered a useful source in the food production chain. Overall the interweaving of human and natural area aims to create a healthy urban ecology.
